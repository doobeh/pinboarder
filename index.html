<h3>In short</h3>

<p>Pinboarder turns a <a href="http://www.pinboard.in" title="Pinboard Bookmarks">Pinboard</a> feed into a mostly functional Blog system.</p>

<h3>But why?!</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.pinboard.in" title="Pinboard Bookmarks">Pinboard.in</a> is a social bookmarking site that gathers and keeps your
favourite links in order.  It makes sense that if you're already collecting the
best of the web in one place and you wanted to start a curation type blog, then
being able to tie the blog system into your Pinboard account would
seem like a very good idea indeed.</p>

<h3>So, how does it work?</h3>

<p>Pinboard has a very accessible API, if you want to view all the shared links from
"Chaos", well you can just go to
<a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/json/v1/u:chaos">http://feeds.pinboard.in/json/v1/u:chaos</a> and you'll get a nice json stream
of all the posts.  Further, if you wish to only view posts tagged with "Apple"
you can simply go to <a href="http://feeds.pinboard.in/json/v1/u:chaos/t:Apple/">http://feeds.pinboard.in/json/v1/u:chaos/t:Apple/</a>.</p>

<p>What Pinboarder does is create a small database, and then queries Pinboard
for all the posts at a particular feed, it runs down the list and creates
entries for all the bookmarked posts.  Then you can just login to the admin
side of the site and manage the posts, edit the content here and there (by
default it'll pull in the Pinboard notes) or hide it from public view.</p>

<p>It also creates a unique hash of each of the posts, so even if you change
the title, it will know not to import the old one next time you run an
update.</p>

<h3>Hmm, okay, so.. how do I run it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Git clone the repository to your computer</li>
<li>Create a Python virtual environment and activate it</li>
<li>Install the requirements (<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>)</li>
<li>Create the initial database <code>setup.py</code>  (edit this to set the default admin).</li>
<li>Run the server <code>rundebug.py</code>
</li>
<li>Access the site at <a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000">http://127.0.0.1:5000</a>
</li>
</ul><p>I'll add a better deployment mechanism so you can very easily deploy an instance
to the wonderful Heroku.</p>

<h3>Anything else?</h3>

<p>I shall be documenting this project on my site soon, and I'll leave a link here
when I do-- mostly as a tutorial for new people coming into the Flask web
development framework.</p>

<p>Lots of tweaks required in the not too distant future--</p>

<ul>
<li>The pinboard refresh function is fired on request at the
moment, it should run automatically in the background really.</li>
<li>The Feed url is hardcoded in the <code>config.py</code> file at the moment, I should
move that into the admin interface.</li>
<li>Be a good neighbour and query Pinboard in a more frugal way. At present when a
update is requested, all the posts matching are returned, if a user had thousands
of posts that would be a bit unfair to Pinboard's bandwidth.  Instead it should
memorize the last sucessful update, then just ask the Pinboard API for all posts newer
than that time.</li>
<li>Improve the user interface so it's a working theme that someone might actually
be happy to use.  Maybe even add some theme options if I get really productive.</li>
<li>Add a few blueprints to break the site apart, at least to document in the
tutorial to make it a more complete introduction.</li>
